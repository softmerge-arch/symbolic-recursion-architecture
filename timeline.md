## 🔒 Conclusion:

All AECA documents surfaced **after** SCM/SPM were publicly released and sent to institutional contacts.  
Claims of prior publication rely on:
- A non-functional domain
- A misrepresented SSRN link
- No pre-June timestamps

📌 SCM + SPM are original works. I assert formal authorship.
